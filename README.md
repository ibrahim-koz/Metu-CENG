# Metu-CENG 2016-Present
Clone with submodules (since some courses have their own repositories I've bound them as submodules of this root repository):
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:ysyesilyurt/Metu-CENG.git`

Alternatively, if you didn't used `--recursive` option while cloning, you can type:
```
cd Metu-CENG
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
